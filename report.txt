
I was very strict with my region of interest, because the fingerprint closer to the border is often faulty, we'll se the the minutiae accuracy next stage.

The Poincare index was harder, I couldn't make the algorithm work with just the slides.
It also usually detects 4 singular points adjacent to each other so a I wrote a reducer.

The classification was pretty straight forward.

> the classification accuracy obtained for type Classification
singular_pts_accuracy= 0.875

> the MSE (Mean Square Error) of the Singular Point Detections between the annotations and the detection found by your implementation
mean mse= 26.683035714285715
